# Building Aaron the Intern, a Generative AI Challenge Lab üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª

Imagine you are the newest engineer at Google Cloud. Your task is helping your GCP customers make their tech work on GCP. You surely would love an intern to do the tedious technical research work for you...

But have you ever tried getting budget for something like that..?! Well, great that you live in the age of AI. So why not just building that intern yourself? Let's call "it": **"Aaron the intern"**.

This lab is designed to guide you through  GCP Generative AI, Langchain, and building real-world applications.  We'll be tackling a series of challenges, each building upon the last, to transform a basic Next.js application into a powerful AI-driven tool.

Your end result will be an interactive, research agent that can take actions on a flexible knowledge base that you define.

## Getting Started with GCP üöÄ

Before you embark on your Gen AI adventure, you'll need to set up your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment.

**1. Create or Select a GCP Project:**

Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), login with your credentials and select the project you have in your sandbox environment. 

**2. Your IDE and Shell in the Cloud:**
*   Open your [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/launching-cloud-shell)
*   Open youd [Cloud Shell Editor](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/launching-cloud-shell-editor)
*   This is your easiest IDE and Shell environment to work through this lab.
*   If you want to work on your local instead, feel free to so and set up auth yourself.

**4. Set up GCP Project and Application Default Credentials (ADC):**

Run the following commands to authenticate yourself and set your project as default in the console:
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud config set project <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
```

## Fork the workshop Content üöÄ
**1. Fork the GitHub Repository:**
*   On GitHub create a [fork of this repository](https://github.com/jakobap/aaron/fork). 
*   Make sure to **include all branches**


**2. Clone the fork into your editing environment:**
*   Back in the Cloud Shell run `git clone <url of your forked repo>`. 


## Set Environment Variables:
**1. Env Vars in .env.local:**
-   Create a new file (in your project root) called `.env.local` based on `.env.template`
-   You will find you Gemini Api Key in [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). You might need to select "Show projects in my organization"
-   Fill out the project ID from your [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome)

**2. Env Vars in terraform.tfvars:**
-   Find the file `terraform/terraform.tfvars` in your project root
-   Fill out the project ID just as you did in `.env.local`


## Deploy the required Infrastructure:

Deploy the required GCP Infrastructure by running the terraform script as follows:

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Running the App
After completing the steps above you are able to run the app and access it on localhost with:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

*Optionally, you can deploy the web app to cloud run by running `make all` in root.*


**Congratulations!** You've completed the basic GCP setup. You are now ready to explore the application and start the challenges!


# Workshop Mechaniccs

We've organized the challenges  using **GitHub Branches** to keep things clear and manageable as you progress through the challenges. Also the use of branches makes each challenge independent from the others. You are free to tackle the individual challenges in any order.

*   **`main` Branch (Your Starting Point):** This is where you are right now! It contains the base application (and full solution!) ‚Äì  You can explore the initial setup, run the app, and get familiar with the codebase.  This branch will remain untouched as you work through the challenges. You can always come back or compare to main for the challenge solution.

*   **`001-llm-data-mining`, `002-build-knowledgebase`, `003-simple-rag-qa`, `004-advanced-rag`, `005-llm-eval-and-tracing` Branches:**  Each of these branches represents a challenge focussing on different learnings.  You'll switch to these branches to work on each challenge individually. Each challenge branch works independent from the other branches.

*   Each challenge branch contains a challenge specific instruction Markdown file. For challenge 1 this is `001-llm-data-mining.md`. Follow these instructions to find out what to do in each challenge.

**To start a challenge, you'll simply switch to its corresponding branch using Git:**

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout 001-llm-data-mining # For Challenge 1
git checkout 002-build-knowledgebase # For Challenge 2, and so on...
```

**Don't worry about messing things up!** Because each challenge is in its own branch, you can experiment freely. If you ever want to start fresh, you can always return to the `main` branch or reset your challenge branch back to origin (as long as you don't push your changes).
